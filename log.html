          i don't know what drew me to this game specifically but the goofy artstyle and slapstick premise definitely helped
        </p>
        <p>
          it's good, polished, platformer fun where you reverse the hot-dogification of old people and free pancake people from dinosaur tyranny, among other shenanigans with your giraffe and pet rock.
          the levels are really fun and there's some real mechanic gems in there.
          the references to media hidden in the stickers were a fun surprise - easter eggs are always great
        </p>
        <p>
          i need to finish my co-op playthrough with my friend at some point it's a good time

        <p>
          okay this might be surprising but this is one of my most played games. period.
        </p>
        <p>
          i know it's a free game which is made to catch whales who will fork out thousands for gem apples but the gameplay rocks.
          there is four different classes you can play as which all complement each other really well which you use to fight kirby bosses.
          i main the doctor because of the potion move which has high dps and healing.
          the movesets of all the classes (the others being sword, hammer and mage) go quite deep actually which is awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          we love player expression here.
        </p>
        <p>
          there is some some cool custom bosses made for this but considering i haven't played star allies they were all new.
          parallel knightmare and galacta knight were really cool.
        </p>
        <p>
          i did pay like two quid one time because i had some credit left over but nothing else.
          i don't think i'll ever pay money on a free game ever again lol

        <p>
          i actually had never heard of shovel knight when i got it.
        </p>
        <p>
          looking it up now, i know it was one of the first successful kickstarter stories
          which is really cool and i really think it still is fantastic
        </p>
        <p>
          the first campaign is the shovel of hope.
          as the first entry, it did an incredible job at establishing the world, cast and vibe of the series.
          the order of no quarter is such a quirky group of knights who are a joy to watch and fight.
          the central mechanic of the pogo is used in so many creative ways and the chiptune music genuinely goes hard (lich yard my beloved).
          you can really tell that the developers believed in the philosophy of limitations breeding creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          plague of shadows is generally the least favourite campaign among the fanbase.
          it is my absolute fucking favourite.
          the movement you get with the bomb burst is so cool and the amount you can customise your bombs is great.
          the side areas of the levels where you can get relics can get super challenging and i love it.
          but i think the thing i love most about this campaign is the story.
          over the course of playing you understand plague knight a lot more.
          he's just a little guy.
          he's awkward, eccentric and wants to prove he's good enough.
          he fumbles his relationship with mona because of it but shows how much he cares in the end.
          and it ends so sweetly with a waltz.
          i need to replay it but can't because i traded it temporarily with a friend for tears of the kingdom
        </p>
        <p>
          urgh...specter of torment is the fan favourite but it is really good...and really edgy.
          specter knight is really cool to control - he can skateboard, run on walls and do a glorified bomb burst when you get the button prompt.
          that's not a joke that's literally <a href="https://youtu.be/8fjCKMIE1Pg?t=415">what the developers did</a>
          the levels are really tightly designed for him (just imagine what that could've been like for my skrunkly plague knight)
        </p>
        <p>
          king knight is a really fun campaign as well - his bash and pirouette are really cool design choices
          and it was interesting how different the world was from his perspective.
          i didn't think the card game was that fun to be honest and it took me ages to beat cardia so i could actually fight her.
          but otherwise just like specter the levels were really tightly designed for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          treasure trove has some extras as well - challenges i'm shit at, genderbend mode (very fun) and showdown!
          showdown is actually a really fun platform fighter and the movesets of each character really suit them.
          the story mode is fun and like many a fighting game i'm not amazing but it is great.

          what more is there to say about hollow knight? it's a fucking masterpiece
        </p>
        <p>
          world? flawless. atmosphere? incredible. music? gorgeous. combat? brilliant. design? masterful.
        </p>
        <p>
          it really innovated the metroidvania genre and inspired so many indie devs to make their own...
          maybe too many given how ridiculously saturated the market is nowadays -
          you really have to stand out to be a success

        <p>
          spiritfarer broke me over and over again but i love it for that.
          it's the type of game you should only play once.
          you really need to play it firsthand.
          it's such a beautiful experience that i'll be doing it a disservice here but i'll try my best.
        </p>
        <p>
          the archipelago is enormous and the variety in gameplay is really cool.
          i love the little minigames which have you rushing all around the ship
          but the more cosy tasks have their charm as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          as you tend to the spirits on your ship you interact with them, learn about them, their lives, their hopes, their dreams, their regrets.
          you do your best to comfort them, fulfill some of their wishes, cook their comfort foods, be their friend.
          but of course then you have to say goodbye
        </p>
        <p>
          this is the heartwrenching part
        </p>
        <p>
          you know it's their time but still you want to hold onto them just that bit longer.
          when you finally decide to go there's always this slow, final boat trip to the everdoor.
          on the way they talk to you so genuinely, maybe talk about what's waiting for them.
          and then you arrive.
          they deliver a line that strikes you to your core.
          they wrap you in a warm embrace.
          they're gone.
          and you're still here.
          man.
          it's just so special.

        <p>
          i thought i would have been a bit alienated from deltarune when i first picked it up
          since at the time i knew nothing about undertale.
          but this wasn't the case at all - no undertale knowledge was required to fall in love with the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          the colours and landscapes of the dark world are so cool and wonderfully bizarre
          and the game never makes it clear if it's make-believe or something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          i actually wasn't expecting there to be so much mechanical difficulty in the combat.
          i like the agency you get when approaching combat on whether to attack or resolve a situation peacefully.
          bullet hells have never been a massive strength of mine but learning attack patterns was very satisfying.
          i really felt like i earnt my pacifist win against jevil.
          the punch-out against queen at the end of chapter 2 was bloody insane as it should've been
        </p>
        <p>
          the cast has so many characters i have claimed as my blorbos.
          i endlessly adore chapter 1 ralsei to the ends of the earth and will fight anyone about it.
          my other faves are susie, jevil, seam and queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          the dialogue had me laughing uncontrollably at how funny it was.
          some of it is extremely witty but there's also some small random stuff thrown in there which cracked me up
        </p>
        <p>
          i am always blown away at how incredible the soundtrack is -
          my favourites are field of hopes and dreams, the world revolving, A CYBER'S WORLD?, smart race, and attack of the killer queen

          a hat in time is packed to the brim with charm
        </p>
        <p>
          while nowadays i find the movement a bit limited the level design does plenty of heavy lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          the characters and worlds still stick in my mind.
          each of them have their own cool vibes:
          <ul>
            <li>mafia town is such a quaint island full of a gang who haven't foggiest idea how to do anything</li>
            <li>dead bird studio pits two cut-throat birds against each in the race to the film awards</li>
            <li>subcon forest has a tragic backstory but when you arrive you bring some happiness to the place</li>
            <li>alpine skyline has so much culture and freedom to explore</li>
            <li>the cruise's seals are so fucking cute and ship shape is such an intense mission</li>
            <li>nyakuza metro took freedom to the next level and is such a unique setting</li>
          </ul>
          the rifts are such a great addition as well.
          from them you get fragments of what really went on with these people and places
        </p>
        <p>
          some of the music really slaps - my faves are sleepy subcon, train rush and clocktowers beneath the sea
        </p>
        <p>

        <p>
          super mario odyssey was my first game on the switch and really deserves all the praise its been given.
        </p>
        <p>
          the movement is so expressive and the worlds are so well conceptualised and designed -
          every nook and cranny has something to find, although this can be a bit annoying when playing to full completion.
          i don't really mind this moon overinflation except some of the really gimmicky moons (fuck jump rope genius).
        </p>
        <p>
          the game can get pretty challenging, especially in the dark and darker sides, but they're not unfair and are fun to complete.
