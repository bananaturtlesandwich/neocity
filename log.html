        this is my log!
        a relatively exhaustive list of media i've consumed in a roughly chronological order and my thoughts on them.
        i will only put media on here that i think is worth talking about so i won't put any generic novels or mediocre shovelware here.
        it is by no means complete and will continue to grow as long as i continue to be a huge fucking nerd :p

      <div id="games" hidden>
        i love games - they combine all different techniques and can incorporate story, art, interactivity, worldbuilding, music and so much else.
        because you take control you can really immerse yourself in a world
        or you can just play a simple little puzzle game.
        both are valid.
        although i fucking hate microtransactions.
        fuck that.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('wii')" class="platform">#wii</a>
      <div id="wii" hidden>
        the wii was my first console.
        i got it as a birthday present when i was around six but didn't play it much until years later.
        i think the simplicity of the wii-mote and novelty of motion controls removed a lot of mental tax in control schemes
        but also felt a bit limiting for more technical games
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('gameboy')" class="platform">#gameboy</a>
      <div id="gameboy" hidden>
        my dad had a gameboy which has now been passed on ceremoniously to me.
        despite how miniscule the screen is, it is such a charming little handheld console.
        i'm a big fan of the tiny sprites and chirpy audio
        and have found a bunch of good cartridges for it from CEX...
        although i do also have a bunch of shovelware on it from my dad
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('3DS')" class="platform">#3DS</a>
      <div id="3DS" hidden>
        my mum actually never knew i had a 3DS.
        since she wasn't often home due to business trips,
        my dad got me a 3DS which she wouldn't have been very happy with
        because she used to be quite strict.
        i managed to get a bunch of games for it from my cousin (who sucks).
        the 3D view is really awesome i wish more consoles had that feature.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('PC')" class="platform">#PC</a>
      <div id="PC" hidden>
        i didn't really think of the pc as a platform until i got steam during the pandemic.
        but as soon as i got into modding i suddenly had a lot more interest in getting games on the pc
        (even if my computer specifications aren't exactly up to scratch).
        i also have a bunch of freebies from epic and amazon games
        (which a lot of people literally have no idea exists)
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('switch')" class="platform">#switch</a>
      <div id="switch" hidden>
        i got my switch for christmas in the year of the pandemic.
        it's so convenient to have by virtue of being a hybrid console
        and being able to play handheld and on the big screen.
        i also have an industrial-grade travel case for it so it can go anywhere i do

      <a onclick="filter('3D platformer')" class="genre">#3D platformer</a>
      <div id="3D platformer" hidden>
        3D platformers might be my favourite game genre at the moment.
        the extra axis of movement introduces so much freedom,
        lending itself to larger spaces and incredible variety in movesets
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('2D platformer')" class="genre">#2D platformer</a>
      <div id="2D platformer" hidden>
        although the pool of 2D platformer games is full of baby's first games and a shit ton of shovelware,
        there really is some gems in the genre which you can find.
        these games can still be very diverse in movesets with enough creativity from developers.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('metroidvania')" class="genre">#metroidvania</a>
      <div id="metroidvania" hidden>
        the focus on exploration and ability-based progression makes metroidvanias very cool to me.
        they lend themselves to large, interconnected worlds which have incredibly deep lore which is always so fucking cool.
        but nowadays the genre is so saturated that standing out is extremely difficult.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('rpg')" class="genre">#rpg</a>
      <div id="rpg" hidden>
        honestly, an rpg really has to be special to appeal to me.
        it's not normally my type of game but there is some which slipped through the cracks
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('roguelike')" class="genre">#roguelike</a>
      <div id="roguelike" hidden>
        i think the reason i don't play more roguelikes is because they have infinite replayability
        so would take up a lot of my time if i had more in my library.
        although a lot of roguelikes don't have enough variety to stay fresh and fun.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('zelda')" class="franchise">#zelda</a>
      <div id="zelda" hidden>
        i love the zelda franchise for its sense of adventure, its deep lore and its puzzle box dungeons.
        breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom took the genre in the open-world direction.
        i didn't really like that in the process they chose to dumb down the dungeons and make the world empty
        (since there is such a massive area to fill with content)
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('pokemon')" class="franchise">#pokemon</a>
      <div id="pokemon" hidden>
        i do love the world of pokemon.
        so many awesome creatures with their own (often dark) origins.
        the battle system hold a surprising amount of depth
        and battles can be fun to strategise around when well designed.
        personally, i don't think the mainline games have been good since sun and moon and haven't played any past it.
        the move to switch meant a doubled price for a buggier game of the same scope and DLC that cost the same.
        while i like some of the newer designs most don't really do it for me.
        fangames are where the innovation is happening and i firmly believe this will continue to be the case.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('films')" class="category">#films</a>
      <div id="films" hidden>
        films and cinema are very special.
        for that hour to two hours of screentime
        (yes that's how long films should be)
        to stick with you the film-makers need to do a damn good job.
        the acting, cinematography, effects and sound design all work together to communicate stories and experiences.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('shows')" class="category">#shows</a>
      <div id="shows" hidden>
        shows are very much in the vain of films but have even more oppurtunity for character development and worldbuilding
        because of the drastic increase in screentime.
        they can be fun and episodic but in terms of show storytelling,
        serialisation is the best way to go (or a hybrid like teen titans)
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('books')" class="category">#books</a>
      <div id="books" hidden>
        although books lack the visual and audio aspect, this can be a strength.
        when reading, your mind creates its own details and idea of what characters look like or how they act
        which may contrast completely with someone else's interpretation.
        you can imagine scenes which would be technically extremely challenging and costly to make on screen.
        this can make worlds feel more personal because nobody perceives it how you have in your head.
      </div>
      <a onclick="filter('podcasts')" class="category">#podcasts</a>
      <div id="podcasts" hidden>
        much like books, podcasts only use a single sense in audio,
        which means worlds and characters are open to the interpretation of your mind.
        i'm not much of a podcast listener but horror/thriller stories really lend themselves to this
        as you can't see the threat but you can hear it.

          this is what i'm currently playing and i am loving it so far
        </p>
        <p>
          the levels are designed in such a way that you have a nice balance between exploration and platforming.
          the core moveset is simple but versatile and the level mechanics and design mean that you are constantly using all of it.
          you can really get into a flow state because of it and that's super fun.
          i like that you can fully complete a level the first time you enter
          (which makes sense considering they're linear levels with room for exploration
          but still it means game time isn't padded out by revisiting old content which is a major pain point of mine)
        </p>
        <p>
          visually, the game is really pretty - i think the style they went with works really well.
          spyro's animation communicates every move so clearly
          (i love his run cycle so much it's just full of life)
        </p>
        <p>
          i can't speak much for how similar the game is to the original but from what i've heard it's pretty good.
          i believe they've done a lot of good quality of life changes and improved the game feel a lot and it feels great to play.

          i traded shovel knight: treasure trove with my friend for this game...
          i still haven't got shovel knight back from them and they still haven't played it which is a bit annoying.
        </p>
        <p>
          since i never played breath of the wild all of hyrule was completely new to me.
          the addition of the sky and depths probably didn't help with how overwhelmed with content i was.
          honestly i felt like a lot of these worlds were just empty.
          it's kind of sad how modern games feel like they have to create such a massive amount of content for players -
          it contributes to the prevalence of crunch in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          maybe this type of zelda game isn't for me.
          i don't know.
        </p>
        <p>
          i really enjoyed the storylines of each area of the game and the dungeons.
          the sudden appearance of zonai artifacts and disappearance of sheikah technology wasn't really ever explained but i dig the vibes.
          the characters were great and having your own little crew of glowy airheads was a fun addition.
          there isn't too much to say about those areas because they're the classic zelda environments
          but the variety of biomes around the rest of the map is something i am a big fan of.
          the bosses were really cinematic and epic (colgera is so awesome).
          the puzzles were...i mean i don't really care for the building part of the game
          but there was a few where i got "aha" moments which felt great.
        </p>
        <p>
          i don't really like sidequests because they didn't feel like things i would want to do when the story is right there.
          i didn't end up finishing the daily gazette and yiga shenanigans
          (although i did fight kohga all the times because he's so goofy).
        </p>
        <p>
          my friend was very frustrated that i never went where i was supposed to go -
          she accused me of being ADHD with how much i just never followed the map
          (to be fair i did have the minimap off because i hate just following an arrow).
          i really loved exploring hyrule and finding little monuments
          but after a certain point (after fighting ganon) i thought it was too much to do
          and there wasn't much point if i wasn't going to find much.

          enter the gungeon has so much passion put into it it's insane.
        </p>
        <p>
          every aspect of the world, from the enemies to the environments to the lore is gun-themed.
          the variety of guns you can get on runs is so damn fun and there's some cool references sprinkled in as well
          (i am a sucker for references lol)
        </p>
        <p>
          i love that despite being a shooter it is primary a bullet hell.
          the enemies on their own have simple bullet patterns
          but when combined, patterns which are extremely satifying to weave through emerge.
          the bosses are especially cool tests of skill (fuck ammoconda though)
        </p>
        <p>
          the game really does reward skillful play by giving extra hearts for mastery of bosses and randomly spawning items.
          bonus stages were a really cool thing i didn't know about which give more chances at cool weapons and items but are hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          unfortunately for me, i'm not the best at bullet hells and enter the gungeon is a fucking hard one
          so most of the time i don't make it past the third stage :p

          it's good, polished, platformer fun where you reverse the hot-dogification of old people and free pancake people from dinosaur tyranny, among other shenanigans with your giraffe and pet rock.
          the levels are really fun and there's some real mechanic gems in there.
          the references to media hidden in the stickers were a fun surprise - easter eggs are always great

        <p>
          i know it's a free game which is made to catch whales who will fork out thousands for gem apples but the gameplay rocks.
          there is four different classes you can play as which all complement each other really well which you use to fight kirby bosses.
          i main the doctor because of the potion move which has high dps and healing.
          the movesets of all the classes (the others being sword, hammer and mage) go quite deep actually which is awesome.

          we love player expression here.

          there is some some cool custom bosses made for this but considering i haven't played star allies they were all new.
          parallel knightmare and galacta knight were really cool.

          i actually had never heard of shovel knight when i got it.
        </p>
        <p>
          looking it up now, i know it was one of the first successful kickstarter stories
          which is really cool and i really think it still is fantastic
        </p>
        <p>
          the first campaign is the shovel of hope.
          as the first entry, it did an incredible job at establishing the world, cast and vibe of the series.
          the order of no quarter is such a quirky group of knights who are a joy to watch and fight.
          the central mechanic of the pogo is used in so many creative ways and the chiptune music genuinely goes hard (lich yard my beloved).
          you can really tell that the developers believed in the philosophy of limitations breeding creativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          plague of shadows is generally the least favourite campaign among the fanbase.
          it is my absolute fucking favourite.
          the movement you get with the bomb burst is so cool and the amount you can customise your bombs is great.
          the side areas of the levels where you can get relics can get super challenging and i love it.
          but i think the thing i love most about this campaign is the story.
          over the course of playing you understand plague knight a lot more.
          he's just a little guy.
          he's awkward, eccentric and wants to prove he's good enough.
          he fumbles his relationship with mona because of it but shows how much he cares in the end.
          and it ends so sweetly with a waltz.
          i need to replay it but can't because i traded it temporarily with a friend for tears of the kingdom
        </p>
        <p>
          urgh...specter of torment is the fan favourite but it is really good...and really edgy.
          specter knight is really cool to control - he can skateboard, run on walls and do a glorified bomb burst when you get the button prompt.
          that's not a joke that's literally <a href="https://youtu.be/8fjCKMIE1Pg?t=415">what the developers did</a>
          the levels are really tightly designed for him (just imagine what that could've been like for my skrunkly plague knight)
        </p>
        <p>
          king knight is a really fun campaign as well - his bash and pirouette are really cool design choices
          and it was interesting how different the world was from his perspective.
          i didn't think the card game was that fun to be honest and it took me ages to beat cardia so i could actually fight her.
          but otherwise just like specter the levels were really tightly designed for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          treasure trove has some extras as well - challenges i'm shit at, genderbend mode (very fun) and showdown!
          showdown is actually a really fun platform fighter and the movesets of each character really suit them.
          the story mode is fun and like many a fighting game i'm not amazing but it is great.

          but the more cosy tasks have their charm as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          as you tend to the spirits on your ship you interact with them, learn about them, their lives, their hopes, their dreams, their regrets.
          you do your best to comfort them, fulfill some of their wishes, cook their comfort foods, be their friend.
          but of course then you have to say goodbye
        </p>
        <p>
          this is the heartwrenching part
        </p>
        <p>
          you know it's their time but still you want to hold onto them just that bit longer.
          when you finally decide to go there's always this slow, final boat trip to the everdoor.
          on the way they talk to you so genuinely, maybe talk about what's waiting for them.
          and then you arrive.
          they deliver a line that strikes you to your core.
          they wrap you in a warm embrace.
          they're gone.
          and you're still here.
          man.
          it's just so special.

          i thought i would have been a bit alienated from deltarune when i first picked it up
          since at the time i knew nothing about undertale.
          but this wasn't the case at all - no undertale knowledge was required to fall in love with the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          the colours and landscapes of the dark world are so cool and wonderfully bizarre
          and the game never makes it clear if it's make-believe or something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          i actually wasn't expecting there to be so much mechanical difficulty in the combat.
          i like the agency you get when approaching combat on whether to attack or resolve a situation peacefully.
          bullet hells have never been a massive strength of mine but learning attack patterns was very satisfying.
          i really felt like i earnt my pacifist win against jevil.
          the punch-out against queen at the end of chapter 2 was bloody insane as it should've been
        </p>
        <p>
          the cast has so many characters i have claimed as my blorbos.
          i endlessly adore chapter 1 ralsei to the ends of the earth and will fight anyone about it.
          my other faves are susie, jevil, seam and queen.
        </p>
        <p>
          the dialogue had me laughing uncontrollably at how funny it was.
          some of it is extremely witty but there's also some small random stuff thrown in there which cracked me up
        </p>
        <p>
          i am always blown away at how incredible the soundtrack is -
          my favourites are field of hopes and dreams, the world revolving, A CYBER'S WORLD?, smart race, and attack of the killer queen

          a hat in time is packed to the brim with charm

          while nowadays i find the movement a bit limited the level design does plenty of heavy lifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          the characters and worlds still stick in my mind.
          each of them have their own cool vibes:
          <ul>
            <li>mafia town is such a quaint island full of a gang who haven't foggiest idea how to do anything</li>
            <li>dead bird studio pits two cut-throat birds against each in the race to the film awards</li>
            <li>subcon forest has a tragic backstory but when you arrive you bring some happiness to the place</li>
            <li>alpine skyline has so much culture and freedom to explore</li>
            <li>the cruise's seals are so fucking cute and ship shape is such an intense mission</li>
            <li>nyakuza metro took freedom to the next level and is such a unique setting</li>
          </ul>
          the rifts are such a great addition as well.
          from them you get fragments of what really went on with these people and places
        </p>
        <p>
          some of the music really slaps - my faves are sleepy subcon, train rush and clocktowers beneath the sea
        </p>

          yes i know i'm a muppet for playing it on the switch when the modding community on pc is prolifically incredible but here we are

          super mario odyssey was my first game on the switch and really deserves all the praise its been given.
        </p>
        <p>
          the movement is so expressive and the worlds are so well conceptualised and designed -
          every nook and cranny has something to find, although this can be a bit annoying when playing to full completion.
          i don't really mind this moon overinflation except some of the really gimmicky moons (fuck jump rope genius).
        </p>
        <p>
          the game can get pretty challenging, especially in the dark and darker sides, but they're not unfair and are fun to complete.

          this was my first pokemon game!

        <p>
          i love the designs in this generation -
          i just wish there was more since kanto pokemon still have a dominating presence and i knew them from the anime.
        </p>
        <p>
          i still managed to get a full team of johto pokemon i adore though!

          i was a big fan of the open-ended middle of the game where you could do stuff in any order.
          of course this had the consequence of interesting (bad) level scaling later but was really neat.
        </p>
        <p>
          the entirety of the kanto region being in the game is pretty awesome.
          i love the changes made and the progression of time for the gym leaders.
        </p>

          fuck red though - the only way to beat him is to grind

          it's a classic what can i say
        </p>
        <p>
          there's plenty of versions of tetris nowadays that i could be playing but i'll always prefer this one.
          i just love this version with its muted colours and chirpy arrangement of korobeiniki.
