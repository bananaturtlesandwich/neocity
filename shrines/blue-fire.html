      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          i first heard about blue fire from its
          <a href="https://youtu.be/TPDIlhB0emM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement trailer</a>
          in a
          <a href="https://youtu.be/PHUIV8DYptQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nintendo indie world showcase</a>
          which announced it for summer 2020 (the pandemic meant otherwise).
          as soon as i watched it i was immediately captivated by its atmosphere, music, platforming, environments, enemies and characters.
        </p>
        <p>
          its entire world just enamored me and i wanted to know more
        </p>

      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          so i searched the game up and somehow found a link to its discord community (i think on the studio website).
          for context this was the first time i had ever done anything social on the internet (surprising since i'm a 2000s kid ik) -
          i had only ever really used it for emails, youtube and searching info.
          so after making a discord account, into the server i dropped...
        </p>
        <img src="blue-fire/welcome.png" alt="welcome from the blue fire server" style="width: 100%">
        <p>
          the devs and everyone else on the server were so lovely!
          it was really a great first experience of online togetherness
          i'm not sure i'll be able to capture the magic of again.
        </p>
        <img src="blue-fire/orip.png" alt="welcome from the orip bot" style="width: 100%">
        <p>
          and of course i was greeted by the engineer of penumbra himself, orip
          (unfortunately he's is no longer operational so i suppose this counts as lost media)
        </p>
        <p>
          i would spend hours in the evenings just talking on the server - we even had our wonderful duck cult.
          in hindsight i realise the pandemic lockdown meant i had the time to keep track of everything happening there.
          i think the fact that the community was fairly small meant that the interactions felt so much more intimate.
          not that i didn't want more people excited about the game just that i could easily know all the other active members.
        </p>
        <p>
          even though that was only 4 years ago at the time of writing, i already feel nostalgic for when the server was always buzzing with activity.
          nowadays the server is very quiet and doesn't see much discussion apart from questions to the devs or people asking for help
          which is a shame since i loved talking with a lot of people there
          (xel, photo, evolair, luukie13, squishie, nicky, youtube101, kito you're awesome).

      <summary>DEMO</summary>
      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          the demo was released to day one supporters (people who joined the discord early) a week early
          and i'm still so gutted i could've been part of that group had i heard about the game earlier.
          the demo still released to the public though and i got my hands on it
        </p>
        <p>
          like every great demo it left me longing for the full game - the movement, overall gameplay and vibe were really great.
          it also still had separate buttons for vertical and horizontal slashes (kind of glad that was removed).
          it released with fire keep and the uthas temple (starting area and second temple) which was a fair chunk of the game.
          people were speedrunning it like crazy (bridge skip was cool and just going around the gate in uthas was left in).
          although i was surprised how little the atmosphere of the areas reflected the announcement trailer -
          but i wasn't concerned because we'd get those cooler areas in the full game...right?

      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          graffiti games, the publisher, released an
          <a href="https://youtu.be/zVPMkBGd1zU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview trailer</a>
          which showed off a large portion of the game
          and is the last trailer showing the all black enemies and shadow lords with detailed texturing
        </p>
        <p>
          relyea, well known hollow knight youtuber, did a
          <a href="https://youtu.be/soEBdEDqT_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev interview</a>
          with gabriel which gave us a bunch of info to be excited about.
        </p>
        <p>
          a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlgsCIOqdEQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release date announcement trailer</a>
          was released and it looked awesome - some new areas were revealed which looked really damn cool
          but the areas from the initial trailer no longer seemed to exist and the enemy designs had been colorised.
        </p>
        <p>
          the devs explained they cut a lot of content for budget and time constraints,
          which was a real shame that the game could not release at its full potential
          but very understandable for an indie studio who developed in the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          i was signed up to a newsletter from graffiti games which sent out some behind-the-scenes footage for blue fire.
          <img src="blue-fire/leak.png" alt="behind the scenes" style="width: 100%">

          <img src="blue-fire/test.png" alt="test" style="width: 33%">
          this included clips of a cut boss, SIRION (A MAJOR BOSS) AND QUEEN (THE FINAL BOSS).
          apparently they hadn't been given permission to post that footage so it was quickly taken down!
          i just wish i had the forethought to download the videos - yet more lost media :p

          it finally released with on a

          (although i think that's standard for graffiti games releases) -
          they even got failboat to promote it in a sponsored
          <a href="https://youtu.be/QEo-kbHEi2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.
          i do wish i got myself an umby but alas teenage lack of financial freedom...oh shit the blue fire t-shirts are still being sold on the
          <a href="https://graffiti-games.myshopify.com/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graffiti games store</a>
          i gotta get one.
        </p>
        <p>
          i think blue fire was quite well received in general by critics.
          from my perpective it didn't sell as well as it deserved.
          obviously it is an indie game so wasn't going to sell as well as a game from an established studio
          but i think the pandemic was a major factor
          since it changed development cycles and meant more difficult decisions in regards to choices in game direction
          and of course delayed the release which meant that initial hype had died down more and more people had forgotten about it.
          i may be completely wrong about this though this was just the impression i got.

      <summary>REVIEW</summary>
      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          of course i got it on day one and i got to playing the game i'd been obsessing over for months.
        </p>
        <p>
          the floaty movement is still just as fun to use but spirits can make the game feel a bit too easy
          so i normally play without very many movement ones equipped.
          the voids which test the movement are really challenging yet still very fun (although douklans leap was rough).
          the spin attack, wallrun and fire charm are definitely the best balanced movement options
          and feel much more satisfying to use than the dash, double dash, double jump and triple jump.
          the combat works really well i think and the bosses are really well-designed around it.
          the characters are very charming and have really cool designs (nilo and orip my beloved)
          and the sidequests give them even more personality and expand on the lore.
          i find the lore and world the game has created very compelling and leaves me wanting to see more of penumbra.
        </p>
        <p>
          now that my hype has died down i think i can review the game a bit more critically.
          i still love the game very dearly but there are definitely flaws i was overlooking due to said hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          the biggest flaw is the pacing of the game.
          by this i don't just mean game length because not every game is able to produce a large amount of content
          but the allocation of types of gameplay and levels of excitement.
          the start of the game is really good with this
          as it mixes combat, exploration and platforming together without one overshadowing the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          however once once the three temples (steam house was a shortened fire temple) are completed,
          the game is just a backtracking exercise to fight the shadow lords and get to the queen.
          this is especially jarring considering there is little backtracking otherwise (the game is pretty linear).
          samael has you activating flames around the map
          and beira has you collecting pieces of her soul like in the spirit tear sections from twilight princess.
          when you point out that sirion has an entire area and dungeon it becomes quite obvious they didn't have enough time or money to do the other shadow lords justice
          but still wanted to give them a substantial part of the game.
        </p>
        <p>
          choosing to pad out the runtime was not the best solution and really impacts enjoyment at the end
          (although the movement spirits make this a bit more bearable).
          i honestly think if the shadow lord doors were immediately accessible after the tower of gods
          the game would have been a much better experience (even if shorter)
          which didn't feel like it was giving you busywork.
        </p>
        <p>
          my other main criticism is the sidequests
          which are essentially all single fetch quests for items you will find anyway:
          bremur's family photo, fara's mother's necklace, the musicians, barry's rose and nuno's medicine.
          spirit hunter, mork and codi's quests are a bit better since there's multiple items to find in more hidden places
          and you can check in on the characters multiple times throughout
        </p>

        <p>
          blue fire was the game that got me into the incredible world of modding and programming
          and that is probably one of the most amazing thing this game and community has done for me.
          there was talk about support for user generated content but nothing ever really happened until voidmaker which we'll get to.
        </p>
        <p>
          six months after release the community was still extremely active which really was amazing when you think about it
          and shows how much we just talked and i decided to try and see if i could make any modifications without official support.
          lo and behold the only thing that came up when i searched up unreal engine 4 modding was 
          <a href="https://youtu.be/ouf1zBEVeVo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>
          by fatihg which i watched like five times over the next week of trying to understand everything going on until finally, something clicked
          <img src="blue-fire/mod.png" alt="i have created the first blue fire mod" style="width: 100%">
          <img src="blue-fire/hell.jpg" alt="douklan's leap with the word hell written over it" style="width: 100%">
        </p>
        <p>
          of course like most modders starting off i just did a bunch of cosmetic mods
          which are still the majority of the blue fire mods i've put on
          <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/organicspuds/mods?gameId=3956">nexus</a>.
          it meant i learnt basic 3D modelling and i'm quite proud of the zote model tbh.
          but i wanted to do more with the game.
          i wanted to make a randomiser
          (this wouldn't become a reality for a while)

      <summary>DLC</summary>
      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          the leadup to the void of sorrows DLC was very much just as exciting as the leadup to the base game
          since the devs had been hinting at more content for quite some time.
          there was a few patches (i really admire how much effort robi studios put into polish and quality of life improvements)
          and some ducks were added as a very sweet homage to the server meme.
        </p>
          but eventually robi studios put out a teaser on a
          <a href="https://www.robistudios.com/julynewsnewcontentepicgrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>
          on their website.
          of course the final trailer was accidentally posted by graffiti too early but the
          <a href="https://youtu.be/uosHr8YOYtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>
          was eventually posted
        </p>
        <p>
          honestly, i think the void of sorrows dlc is perfect
        </p>
        <p>
          the new voids and boss are fiendishly challenging and exhilarating to complete;
          the lore really feels like an organic expansion to the world;
          the area is really fun to explore and the non-linearity of it was great;
          the easter eggs were extremely well integrated and extremely sweet (i think i cried when i read the robi coin);
          and the new cosmetics are great and made me laugh
        </p>
        <p>
          unfortunately the way the promotion was handled meant that a lot of people have no idea this expansion exists.
          the dlc is hidden behind a door in the fire keep which only lights up if you watched the full credits
          which pretty much no-one did and there isn't a skip button.
          also the dlc was released for free which, while appreciated,
          meant since you didn't have to make any conscious effort to get it
          many people didn't realise it released.
          ALSO WE WANT TO SUPPORT THE STUDIO LET US GIVE YOU MONEY!

      <summary>RANDOMISER</summary>
      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        <p>
          honestly i should probably copy out my devlogs for stove and the rando and put them on their dedicated projects page...
          okay i'll leave out the pain of figuring out the intricacies of map files and the many PRs and backend changes but i did it and figured out how to transplant actors between maps
        </p>
        <p>
          yeah yeah shut up americans for me it's an s not a z.
          for people who don't know a randomiser is a game mode that enhances replayability by shuffling pickups randomly
          while ensuring the game is still beatable without glitches.
          this was where i really started to learn coding because to do this i had to edit the data, not just some 3D models or textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          eventually after a ridiculous amount of digging for specific modding communities for games made in unreal
          i did discover the awesome work of dmgvol in the ghostrunner community and his modding guides
          which mentioned uassetapi so i learned c# just to use it
          <img src="blue-fire/uassetapi.png" alt="uassetapi code" style="width: 100%">
          i honestly didn't really do much with this except changing object positions
        </p>
        <p>
          then buckminsterfullerine dropped into the server and showed us what modding plebians we were,
          showering us with cool tools and resources about blueprints.
          <img src="blue-fire/limited.png" alt="uassetapi is limited" style="width: 100%">
          yeah i'm a stubborn motherfucker.
        </p>
        <p>
          after a couple months of procrastinating actually making the randomiser by making it look pretty in winforms
          i actually started doing some research on how i could implement it.
          my first attempts involved editing the enums and datatables.
          while this worked it only worked within the item types so after i realised this i was kind of stumped
        </p>
        <p>
          i realised since i could change object positions using uassetapi i could make a small map editor to make this easier.
          i originally made this using opentk and the GL_EditorFramework used in spotlight, the super mario 3D world editor.
          in doing this, i noticed that some actors would have properties which other actors of the same type did not
          and after adding in those properties i was delighted see those were used in-game so i could mix drops from chests and change sapphire ore chests
        </p>
        <p>
          it was only by SUMMER 2022 that i finally was getting somewhere and was getting better at coding.
          ALSO CAN I STILL MENTION HOW AWESOME IT WAS WE WERE STILL TALKING ON THE SERVER.
          a lot of the trouble was with figuring out randomiser logic and 3D graphics shenanigans.
          by the end of the holiday i had a broken mess of a randomiser, a questionably functional map editor and i decided to learn rust
          since i had heard that somebody had written a uasset library for the language and i wanted something fresh.
        </p>
        <p>
          it literally only took 2 days for rust to click for me.
          i made a pretty functional uassetgui clone to learn the language and familiarise myself with unreal_asset
          and i also got a commision to make a modding tool for multiversus before modders got shut down and got paid with journey to the savage planet.
        </p>
        <p>
          after the absurd developments with stove i could finally place whatever i wanted in the world.
          that didn't affect cutscenes and npcs though which really sucked.
          of course i eventually found the solution after a bunch of work -
          the shops were located in the savegame blueprint so i could edit them there (actually nilo still doesn't work :p).
          however the npcs were still yet to be figured out.
        </p>
        <p>
          to fix this, naturally i discovered a new modding technique - function library hooking.
          create a dummy of the function library with all the correct function names, inputs and outputs and then duplicate that
          name that duplicate to whatever you want and for each function in it call the original function that is in your dummy (i'd back this duplicate up)
          then you can change the function to do whatever you want
          cook the project and you'll have your hook and your dummy
          delete the dummy
          change any name reference to the function library in the target actor to your hook
          since you didn't include the dummy the game will call the actual functions provided the function target is the dummy along with your stuff
        </p>
        <p>
          the finished logic still wasn't great since it tried to procedurally place items
          rather than check random seeds for beatability
          and that led to all the good items being at the start.
          this wasn't fixed until i made the pseudoregalia randomiser and ported the implementation to the blue fire randomiser
          but there wasn't much fanfare for it as by then another year had gone and the server had essentially come to a standstill :(

        voidmaker was an surprise announcement.
        a level creation tool for blue fire's movement? i'm absolutely in.
        also, instead of being a DLC this would be a standalone free spinoff.
        ROBI LET US PAY FOR YOUR BLOODY AWESOME GAMES!
        i think partially because of it being an spinoff rather than a dlc
        despite the asset sharing it didn't get much attention.
        there's some really cool levels on the platform too
        and they released it as a free update for consoles anyway.
        AND THERE'S SOME BANGER LEVEL MUSIC TOO WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN RELEASED

      <summary>CONCLUSION</summary>
      <div style="margin: 0vw 5vw; text-align: left">
        this was my first shrine and probably the one which i have the most to talk about with as well.
        writing it all out felt great and i definitely want to make it as pretty as the game deserves.
        this game did a lot for me.
        it showed me how great online community can feel and how fun modding and programming can be.
        thank you blue fire and thank you robi studios
