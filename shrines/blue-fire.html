        i first heard about blue fire from its
        <a href="https://youtu.be/TPDIlhB0emM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announcement trailer</a>
        in a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/PHUIV8DYptQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nintendo indie world showcase</a>
        which announced it for summer 2020 (the pandemic meant otherwise).
        as soon as i watched it i was immediately captivated by its atmosphere, music, platforming, environments, enemies and characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        its entire world just enamored me and i wanted to know more
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="community" hidden>
    	<a onclick="turn('demo', 'anticipation')" class="right"> > </a>
      <p>
        so i searched the game up and somehow found a link to its discord community (i think on the studio website).
        for context this was the first time i had ever done anything social on the internet (surprising since i'm a 2000s kid ik) -
        i had only ever really used it for emails, youtube and searching info.
        so after making a discord account, into the server i dropped...
      </p>
      <img src="blue-fire/welcome.png" alt="welcome from the blue fire server" style="width: 100%">
      <p>
        the devs and everyone else on the server were so lovely!
        it was really a great first experience of online togetherness
        i'm not sure i'll be able to capture the magic of again.
      </p>
      <img src="blue-fire/orip.png" alt="welcome from the orip bot" style="width: 100%">
      <p>
        and of course i was greeted by the engineer of penumbra himself, orip
        (unfortunately he's is no longer operational so i suppose this counts as lost media)
      </p>
      <p>
        i would spend hours in the evenings just talking on the server - we even had our wonderful duck cult.
        in hindsight i realise the pandemic lockdown meant i had the time to keep track of everything happening there.
        i think the fact that the community was fairly small meant that the interactions felt so much more intimate.
        not that i didn't want more people excited about the game just that i could easily know all the other active members.
      </p>
      <p>
        even though that was only 4 years ago at the time of writing, i already feel nostalgic for when the server was always buzzing with activity.
        nowadays the server is very quiet and doesn't see much discussion apart from questions to the devs or people asking for help
        which is a shame since i loved talking with a lot of people there
        (xel, photo, evolair, luukie13, squishie, nicky, youtube101, kito you're awesome).

      <p>
        the demo was released to day one supporters (people who joined the discord early) a week early
        and i'm still so gutted i could've been part of that group had i heard about the game earlier.
        the demo still released to the public though and i got my hands on it
      </p>
      <p>
        like every great demo it left me longing for the full game - the movement, overall gameplay and vibe were really great.
        it also still had separate buttons for vertical and horizontal slashes (kind of glad that was removed).
        it released with fire keep and the uthas temple (starting area and second temple) which was a fair chunk of the game.
        people were speedrunning it like crazy (bridge skip was cool and just going around the gate in uthas was left in).
        although i was surprised how little the atmosphere of the areas reflected the announcement trailer -
        but i wasn't concerned because we'd get those cooler areas in the full game...right?

        graffiti games, the publisher, released an
        <a href="https://youtu.be/zVPMkBGd1zU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">overview trailer</a>
        which showed off a large portion of the game
        and is the last trailer showing the all black enemies and shadow lords with detailed texturing
      </p>
      <p>
        relyea, well known hollow knight youtuber, did a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/soEBdEDqT_g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dev interview</a>
        with gabriel which gave us a bunch of info to be excited about.
      </p>
      <p>
        a <a href="https://youtu.be/BlgsCIOqdEQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">release date announcement trailer</a>
        was released and it looked awesome - some new areas were revealed which looked really damn cool
        but the areas from the initial trailer no longer seemed to exist and the enemy designs had been colorised.
      </p>
      <p>
        the devs explained they cut a lot of content for budget and time constraints,
        which was a real shame that the game could not release at its full potential
        but very understandable for an indie studio who developed in the pandemic.
      </p>
      <p>
        i was signed up to a newsletter from graffiti games which sent out some behind-the-scenes footage for blue fire.
        <img src="blue-fire/leak.png" alt="behind the scenes" style="width: 100%">
        <img src="blue-fire/phantom-knight.png" alt="phantom knight" style="width: 33%">

        <img src="blue-fire/test.png" alt="test" style="width: 33%">
        this included clips of a cut boss, SIRION (A MAJOR BOSS) AND QUEEN (THE FINAL BOSS).
        apparently they hadn't been given permission to post that footage so it was quickly taken down!
        i just wish i had the forethought to download the videos - yet more lost media :p
      </p>
      <p>
        the <a href="https://youtu.be/m31G0TcW600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">making of blue fire</a>
        was released which was such a great introspection into the development and evolution of the game
        (plus it was lovely to see the community mentioned...although in the footage i had a typo and it has annoyed me since)

    	<a onclick="turn('demo', 'anticipation')" class="left"> < </a>
      <p>
        it finally released with on a
        <a href="https://youtu.be/R0wPny3_8nQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">launch trailer</a>
        to add to boot and weirdly a
        <a href="https://www.makeship.com/products/umbra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">makeship campaign</a>
        (although i think that's standard for graffiti games releases) -
        they even got failboat to promote it in a sponsored
        <a href="https://youtu.be/QEo-kbHEi2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>.
        i do wish i got myself an umby but alas teenage lack of financial freedom...oh shit the blue fire t-shirts are still being sold on the
        <a href="https://graffiti-games.myshopify.com/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graffiti games store</a>
        i gotta get one.
      </p>
      <p>
        i think blue fire was quite well received in general by critics.
        from my perpective it didn't sell as well as it deserved.
        obviously it is an indie game so wasn't going to sell as well as a game from an established studio
        but i think the pandemic was a major factor
        since it changed development cycles and meant more difficult decisions in regards to choices in game direction
        and of course delayed the release which meant that initial hype had died down more and more people had forgotten about it.
        i may be completely wrong about this though this was just the impression i got.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="review" hidden>
    	<a onclick="turn('modding', 'dlc')" class="right"> > </a>
      <p>
        of course i got it on day one and i got to playing the game i'd been obsessing over for months.
      </p>
      <p>
        the floaty movement is still just as fun to use but spirits can make the game feel a bit too easy
        so i normally play without very many movement ones equipped.
        the voids which test the movement are really challenging yet still very fun (although douklans leap was rough).
        the spin attack, wallrun and fire charm are definitely the best balanced movement options
        and feel much more satisfying to use than the dash, double dash, double jump and triple jump.
        the combat works really well i think and the bosses are really well-designed around it.
        the characters are very charming and have really cool designs (nilo and orip my beloved)
        and the sidequests give them even more personality and expand on the lore.
        i find the lore and world the game has created very compelling and leaves me wanting to see more of penumbra.
      </p>
      <p>
        now that my hype has died down i think i can review the game a bit more critically.
        i still love the game very dearly but there are definitely flaws i was overlooking due to said hype.
      </p>
      <p>
        the biggest flaw is the pacing of the game.
        by this i don't just mean game length because not every game is able to produce a large amount of content
        but the allocation of types of gameplay and levels of excitement.
        the start of the game is really good with this
        as it mixes combat, exploration and platforming together without one overshadowing the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        however once once the three temples (steam house was a shortened fire temple) are completed,
        the game is just a backtracking exercise to fight the shadow lords and get to the queen.
        this is especially jarring considering there is little backtracking otherwise (the game is pretty linear).
        samael has you activating flames around the map
        and beira has you collecting pieces of her soul like in the spirit tear sections from twilight princess.
        when you point out that sirion has an entire area and dungeon it becomes quite obvious they didn't have enough time or money to do the other shadow lords justice
        but still wanted to give them a substantial part of the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        choosing to pad out the runtime was not the best solution and really impacts enjoyment at the end
        (although the movement spirits make this a bit more bearable).
        i honestly think if the shadow lord doors were immediately accessible after the tower of gods
        the game would have been a much better experience (even if shorter)
        which didn't feel like it was giving you busywork.
      </p>
      <p>
        my other main criticism is the sidequests
        which are essentially all single fetch quests for items you will find anyway:
        bremur's family photo, fara's mother's necklace, the musicians, barry's rose and nuno's medicine.
        spirit hunter, mork and codi's quests are a bit better since there's multiple items to find in more hidden places
        and you can check in on the characters multiple times throughout

        blue fire was the game that got me into the incredible world of modding and programming
        and that is probably one of the most amazing thing this game and community has done for me.
        there was talk about support for user generated content but nothing ever really happened until voidmaker which we'll get to.
      </p>
      <p>
        six months after release the community was still extremely active which really was amazing when you think about it
        and shows how much we just talked and i decided to try and see if i could make any modifications without official support.
        lo and behold the only thing that came up when i searched up unreal engine 4 modding was 
        <a href="https://youtu.be/ouf1zBEVeVo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a>
        by fatihg which i watched like five times over the next week of trying to understand everything going on until finally, something clicked

      </p>
      <p>
        of course like most modders starting off i just did a bunch of cosmetic mods
        which are still the majority of the blue fire mods i've put on
        <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/organicspuds/mods?gameId=3956">nexus</a>.
        it meant i learnt basic 3D modelling and i'm quite proud of the zote model tbh.
        but i wanted to do more with the game.
        i wanted to make a randomiser...this only happened after like a year -
        you can read about this whole ordeal in the devlog on the <a href="../coding/blue-fire-rando.html">blue fire rando</a> page

        the leadup to the void of sorrows DLC was very much just as exciting as the leadup to the base game
        since the devs had been hinting at more content for quite some time.
        there was a few patches (i really admire how much effort robi studios put into polish and quality of life improvements)
        and some ducks were added as a very sweet homage to the server meme.
      </p>
        but eventually robi studios put out a teaser on a
        <a href="https://www.robistudios.com/julynewsnewcontentepicgrant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>
        on their website.
        of course the final trailer was accidentally posted by graffiti too early but the
        <a href="https://youtu.be/uosHr8YOYtI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">trailer</a>
        was eventually posted
      </p>
      <p>
        honestly, i think the void of sorrows dlc is perfect
      </p>
      <p>
        the new voids and boss are fiendishly challenging and exhilarating to complete;
        the lore really feels like an organic expansion to the world;
        the area is really fun to explore and the non-linearity of it was great;
        the easter eggs were extremely well integrated and extremely sweet (i think i cried when i read the robi coin);
        and the new cosmetics are great and made me laugh
      </p>
      <p>
        unfortunately the way the promotion was handled meant that a lot of people have no idea this expansion exists.
        the dlc is hidden behind a door in the fire keep which only lights up if you watched the full credits
        which pretty much no-one did and there isn't a skip button.
        also the dlc was released for free which, while appreciated,
        meant since you didn't have to make any conscious effort to get it
        many people didn't realise it released.

        funnily enough von became a villain which might have been an intentional reference to a debate i had with bazop about how trustworthy von was

        voidmaker was an surprise announcement.
        a level creation tool for blue fire's movement? i'm absolutely in.
        also, instead of being a DLC this would be a standalone free spinoff.

        i think partially because of it being an spinoff rather than a dlc
        despite the asset sharing it didn't get much attention.
        there's some really cool levels on the platform too
        and they released it as a free update for consoles anyway.
        AND THERE'S SOME BANGER LEVEL MUSIC TOO WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN RELEASED
