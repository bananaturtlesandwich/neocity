		<h1>perfectionism</h1>
    <div style="text-align: left">
      <p>
        i think because i've made such nice artwork for the other pages i'm a bit frozen on doing more with the website but i am getting unstuck.
        i think this kind of links to my overall perfectionism and the want to make everything to my standards
      </p>
      <p><ul>
        no long project will be perfect on the first pass
        <li>in coding the program will not be optimised immediately</li>
        <li>drawings won't look good if you don't work into them more</li>
        <li>you won't produce a rich piece of writing without iteration</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>
        i don't know if this stems from anything and i've never really gone to a therapist to talk about this
        but my theory is i guess i was kind of a "gifted" kid?
        i've always done well academically in subjects i gave a fuck about
        and i received praise for it and doing better warranted even more
        (i think this also led to a bit of an inferiority complex though)
        plus my mum is an incredible human being and i wanted to achieve as high as she did
      </p>
      <p>
        i mean i guess i kind of achieved that since i'm starting my first academic year at cambridge very soon
        but i suppose the point i'm putting across is i need to learn to let things be unfinished and a work in progress
      </p>
      <p>
        i think i'll start by just typing out the shrine pages without even thinking about making them pretty
        and then i can decorate and stylise them to my heart's content later.
        i really want each shrine to embody its subject rather just be the same crappy spray of pixels you see everywhere else.
        and i suppose for the blog page i think an even trippier vibe would be cool since it's just a swirl of my thoughts but no ideas otherwise.
        i should probably sketch some :)
