      <p>
    		well this is my first blog post on my first website! ISN'T THAT COOL?
        i think i've always wanted a little outlet to just talk about stuff i love that i don't think anyone else really gives a shit about.
      </p>
      <p>
        i initially heard about neocities from a great <a href="https://youtu.be/rTSEr0cRJY8">video</a> about the indie web -
        i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed from what it was and want to be a part of this lovely community.
        i've always been a big believer that the internet is for collaboration and sharing, especially in regards open source software and freely available learning resource.
        additionally, despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
        in terms of what i actually want this website to be i want it to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies.
        one thing i really don't want to be is to add to the pile of unoriginal trash that already exists here
        this website should be my place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
      </p>
      <p>
        what will i actually do here then?
        <ul>
          <li>i want to create a ridiculous amount of shrines!</li>
          <li>i want to talk about subjects on my mind or important to me!</li>
          <li>i want to braindump intricacies of coding stuff!</li>
          <li>i want to make and post covers of tracks i love!</li>
          <li>i want to find other people who like things i like and be their friend!</li>
          <li>i want to find incredible personal websites!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>thank you neocities!</p>
