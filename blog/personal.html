        this is where i write more in depth about myself i guess :p

        i think because i've made such nice artwork for the other pages i'm a bit frozen on doing more with the website but i am getting unstuck.
        i think this kind of links to my overall perfectionism and the want to make everything to my standards
      </p>
      <p><ul>
        <li>no long project will be perfect on the first pass</li>
        <li>programs won't be optimised immediately</li>
        <li>drawings won't look good if you don't work into them</li>
        <li>you won't produce a good piece of writing without iteration</li>
      </ul></p>
      <p>
        i don't know if this stems from anything and i've never really gone to a therapist to talk about this
        but my theory is i guess i was kind of a "gifted" kid?
        i've always done well academically in subjects i gave a fuck about
        and i received praise for it and doing better warranted even more
        (i think this also led to a bit of an inferiority complex though)
        plus my mum is an incredible human being and i wanted to achieve as high as she did
      </p>
      <p>
        i mean i guess i kind of achieved that since i'm starting my first academic year at cambridge very soon
        but i suppose the point i'm putting across is i need to learn to let things be unfinished and a work in progress
      </p>
      <p>
        i think i'll start by just typing out the shrine pages without even thinking about making them pretty
        and then i can decorate and stylise them to my heart's content later.
        i really want each shrine to embody its subject rather just be the same crappy spray of pixels you see everywhere else.
        and i suppose for the blog page i think an even trippier vibe would be cool since it's just a swirl of my thoughts but no ideas otherwise.
        i should probably sketch some :)

    <div id="my first website" hidden>
      <p>
    		well this is my first blog post on my first website! ISN'T THAT COOL?
        i think i've always wanted a little outlet to just talk about stuff i love that no-one else really gives a shit about.
      </p>
      <p>
        i initially heard about neocities from a great <a href="https://youtu.be/rTSEr0cRJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> about the indie web -
        i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed and want to be a part of this lovely community.
        i've always been a big believer that the internet is for collaboration and sharing, especially in regards to open source software and learning resources.
        additionally, despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
        in terms of what i actually want this website to be i want it to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies.
        one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of unoriginal trash that already exists here
        this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
      </p>
      <p>
        what will i actually do here then?
        <ul>
          <li>i want to create a ridiculous amount of shrines!</li>
          <li>i want to talk about subjects on my mind or important to me!</li>
          <li>i want to braindump intricacies of coding stuff!</li>
          <li>i want to make and post covers of tracks i love!</li>
          <li>i want to find other people who like things i like and be their friend!</li>
          <li>i want to find incredible personal websites!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>thank you neocities!</p>
