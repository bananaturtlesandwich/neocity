        this is where i write about my perspectives and experiences
      </p>

      <p>
        if you didn't know i am half british and half chinese.
        have been all my life funnily enough and i think it's granted me a very unique cultural perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        because my dad couldn't speak mandarin (also because my mum was at home less) i didn't speak mandarin at home
        although i did go to a "chinese school" every week to learn the language.
        the school was a place where chinese families could meet and chat while the kids learnt.
        i always felt out of place because i was the only one who didn't have black hair
        (which is weird because every other half'n half person i know does)
        and i personally don't feel i look very chinese anyway,
        although according to other people and a face ai i do.
      </p>
      <p>
        i can speak mandarin fairly well and can hold a conversation with anyone who speaks standard mandarin
        but definitely have more to be desired in terms of language ability because i couldn't speak it at home.
        this hurts how well i can connect with my chinese family -
        although many speak in dialects which sound completely alien anyway.
        of course i love them very much but i do feel slightly disconnected,
        not only because of my background but also because i'm not considered part of the main family line (i don't have the surname).
      </p>
      <p>
        i had two very different cooking styles in my household:
        my dad served cauliflower cheese, casserole, pies and sausages while my mum brought noodles, rice, dumplings, 粥 and 粽子 to the table.
        i loved this and i think it really sucks that most families don't have as large a range of dishes.
        it also meant i didn't hate vegetables like the rest of the people in this country because i had stir-fried vegetables.
        COOK YOUR FUCKING VEGETABLES DON'T PUT THEM IN A SALAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        i was able to experience both cultures simultaneously which was very cool.
        i know quite a few immigrant families don't celebrate a lot of festivals like bonfire night, halloween and christmas
        and obviously most british families don't celebrate 春节, 中秋节, 端午节 or 清明节
        so i felt very priveliged to be able to both trick or treat and make dumplings with good company
      </p>
      <p>
        i honestly don't think the uk's a very racist place, at least where i'm from.
        of course there's the whole 'ching chong' stuff that happens on the playground in primary school
        but other than that i haven't experienced anything and neither have any of my not-ethnically-british friends as far as i know.
      </p>

        funniest story i got from it was getting asked if i was mixed race by a drunk chinese lady at a corner shop at 3 am where i just bought some ginger beer

    		well this is my first blog post on my first website! ISN'T THAT COOL?
        i think i've always wanted a little outlet to just talk about stuff i love that no-one else really gives a shit about.
      </p>
      <p>
        i initially heard about neocities from a great <a href="https://youtu.be/rTSEr0cRJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> about the indie web -
        i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed and want to be a part of this lovely community.
        i've always been a big believer that the internet is for collaboration and sharing, especially in regards to open source software and learning resources.
        additionally, despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
        in terms of what i actually want this website to be i want it to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies.
        one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of unoriginal trash that already exists here
        this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
      </p>
      <p>
        what will i actually do here then?
        <ul>
          <li>i want to create a ridiculous amount of shrines!</li>
          <li>i want to talk about subjects on my mind or important to me!</li>
          <li>i want to braindump intricacies of coding stuff!</li>
          <li>i want to make and post covers of tracks i love!</li>
          <li>i want to find other people who like things i like and be their friend!</li>
          <li>i want to find incredible personal websites!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>thank you neocities!</p>
