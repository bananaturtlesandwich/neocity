  		well this is my first post on my first website! ISN'T THAT COOL?
      i think i've always wanted a little outlet to just talk about stuff i love that no-one else really gives a shit about.
    </p>
    <p>
      i initially heard about neocities from a great <a href="https://youtu.be/rTSEr0cRJY8" target="_blank">video</a> about the indie web -
      i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed and want to be a part of this lovely community.
      i've always been a big believer that the internet is for collaboration and sharing, especially in regards to open source software and learning resources.
      additionally, despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it.

      in terms of what i actually want this website to be i want it to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies.
      one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of linktrees and empty spaces.
      this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
    </p>
    <p>
      what will i actually do here then?
      <ul>
        <li>i want to create a ridiculous amount of shrines!</li>
        <li>i want to talk about subjects on my mind!</li>
        <li>i want to braindump intricacies of coding stuff!</li>
