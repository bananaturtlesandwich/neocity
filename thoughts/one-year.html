    <p>welp. this is crazy. the spud shack is one year old.</p>
    <p>
      honestly when i made a neocities account a year ago i wasn't expecting to get this far
      but i've just had an absolute blast whittling away at this ever-growing website
    </p>
    <p>
      i genuinely can't believe it's been an entire year.
      in meantime i did my first year at university, learnt the accordion surprisingly quick and got really involved with folk music and theatre tech.
    </p>
    <p>
      maybe because of that, starting this site and a bit of coding burnout i've not done as many projects.
      for half the year i basically did nothing except tweak <a href="coding/stove.html">stove</a>
      but i would say that i've kind of gotten back into it now, having made
      <a href="https://skyweb.spuds.casa">skyweb</a> not too long ago and starting work on a game of my own...
      hopefully i'll have more to say about that later
    </p>
    <p>
      in terms of the shack though there's been amazing progress...
      luckily i know the importance of version control so i have every single version of the site right at my fingertips!
      shall we have a look down memory lane?
      (rhetorical question get pulled into my archives idiot)
    </p>
    <p>
      oh wow this is crazy.
      <img src="archive/initial.png" alt="initial home page" style="width: 100%">
      this was the first ever commit!
      at the time i was using a font that really doesn't suit the current fuzzy vibe and everything just linked to my github
      <img src="archive/better.png" alt="better home page" style="width: 100%">
      that's looking for familiar, especially since i've now added the background
      which is actually the texture from blue fire's galaxy cloak downscaled!
      it essentially stayed like this for a bit until i added the hay and the rest of the links and animated myself!
      i'm really pleased with the <a href="../index.html">current</a> look - it just feels cozy!
    </p>
    <p>
      but that's not it! let's have a look at some other first drafts!
      <br>
      <img src="archive/projects.png" alt="projects page" style="width: 32%">
      <img src="archive/coding.png" alt="coding page" style="width: 32%">
      <img src="archive/me.png" alt="me page" style="width: 32%">
      <img src="archive/cities.png" alt="cities page" style="width: 32%">
      <img src="archive/art.png" alt="art page" style="width: 32%">
      <br>
      honestly these are pretty close to the current versions of the 
      <a href="../desk.html">desk</a>,
      <a href="../coding.html">coding</a>,
      <a href="../me.html">me</a>,
      <a href="../art.html">art</a> and
      <a href="../cities.html">cities</a> pages.
      i'm actually quite keen to do a better about me because currently i don't think it's up to par
    </p>
    <p>
      the <a href="../thoughts.html">thoughts</a> page has actually undergone the most iteration out of all the pages
      <img src="archive/blog.png" alt="blog page" style="width: 100%">
      the first draft was just a list of articles and clicking would display one
      <img src="archive/categories.png" alt="categories page" style="width: 100%">
      then i thought that maybe i should categorise them
      <img src="archive/thoughts.png" alt="thoughts page" style="width: 100%">
      and that led to this really fun style which i then ran with for the whole page!
    </p>
    <p>
      and that leaves the <a href="../shrines.html">shrines</a> pages!
      <img src="archive/shrines.png" alt="shrines page" style="width: 100%">
      not much to say about the index it's just a todo list and some links
      <img src="archive/blue-fire.png" alt="blue fire page" style="width: 100%">
      ah <a href="../shrines/blue-fire.html">blue fire</a> was my first one!
      i really wasn't sure what i wanted from it visually so i just regurgitated everything i wanted to write (a lot)
      and slapped it on the starting cutscene in summary tags - i really liked hovering over the onop language decoding it so that was kept.
      the scrapbook aesthetic i ended up with kinda came from it more being a recording of my experiences with the game and community so it felt very personal.
      <img src="archive/pseudoregalia.png" alt="pseudoregalia shrine" style="width: 100%">
      <a href="../shrines/pseudoregalia.html">pseudoregalia</a> was very much a similar case of me being very attached so i built it using the same style
      <img src="archive/modding.png" alt="modding shrine" style="width: 100%">
      i was able to change it up with the <a href="../shrines/modding.html">modding</a> shrine thankfully - i started by implementing the console so it's essentially the same
      <img src="archive/rainworld.png" alt="rainworld shrine" style="width: 100%">
      similarly, i thoroughly planned out the <a href="../shrines/rainworld.html">rainworld</a> shrine which meant it basically came out fully formed
      <img src="archive/pokemon.png" alt="pokemon shrine" style="width: 100%">
      and the <a href="../shrines/pokemon.html">pokemon</a> shrine brings us to the present!
      this one is a huge undertaking and i've kind of slowed down on this front because i'm a bit intimidated by it
      but so far i've talked about the franchise as a whole and stubbed out the rest of the sections with my playthrough teams.
      i have technically already done ultra sun, silver and diamond in the logs but i just need to do the art :p
    </p>
    <p>
      and that concludes a year of the spud shack!
      neocities has been a really cool place to host the site since i get to see other sites grow alongside my own
      and exist among webmasters even more passionate than me which is truly inspiring.
      thank you to everyone following along and here's to another year!
