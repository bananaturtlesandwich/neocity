      unsurprisingly, different games implement the same mechanics in different ways.
      in a genre revolving around simple ones those must feel good -
      however what's perfect for one character or dev will be different for another.
      i did a study of all the 3D platformers i own to find these different perspectives

      higher accelerations increase responsiveness but making them too high can stretch believability.
      umbra treads this line since he reaches max speed in 1560/9000 = 0.17 seconds - that's half sybil's 550/1600 = 0.34 seconds!
      (using MaxWalkSpeed and MaxAcceleration in the player blueprints).

    <p>
      max speeds will also change responsiveness but in more of a sweet spot way -
      high values sacrifice precision while low ones sacrifice the player's patience.
      max speeds can also change e.g going down a slope or sprinting you'll be able to go faster than you could walking on flat ground.
    </p>

    <p>
      turning is also involved in this responsiveness balance as characters shouldn't be able to make sharp turns instantly.
      again, umbra shows how light a character can feel if this is the case.
      to acknowledge this, most games will have some sort of skid state or animation if you make too extreme a turn.
      but even for less extreme turns characters like sev and mario have lower turn rates (and accelerations) to sell their heft.

    <p>
      you can't really fall backwards if you didn't start going backwards.
      but that can make mistakes feel more punishing, so many characters don't change how turning works in the air e.g hat kid.
      even when this is changed, it's only slightly muted so that you can still

      in terms of jump arcs you'd probably assume that all jumps would just follow parabolic motion (a symmetrical curve) like in real life.
      honestly, if not for this <a href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/devin-article-raz-jump" target="_blank">blog post</a> i wouldn't have noticed
      raz's gravity in psychonauts 2 at the peak of his jump is lower to allow for better precision.
      while i can understand this, ultimately it may be overengineering a problem which didn't need solving.

    <!-- rambling about cameras
    <p>
      okay you get some more rambling on cameras. my treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      if a camera directly follows a character it can feel a bit jerky since every time the character jumps there's movement.
      a very simple fix surprisingly absent in most games is to not move the camera for jumps which will land on the same elevation.
      however if not handled gracefully this might result in a bigger jerk whenever the player lands
    </p>
    <p>
      the camera also has to contend with the environment.
      if the player is blocked by an object then you might be unsure where they've gone.
      spyro deals with this by always having the camera snap to ensure he's visible.
      many games have the character silhouette show over geometry although seeing the character is still important.
      this allows the camera to snap less but different games will snap differently either way.
      mario odyssey has snapping if otherwise the camera would be clipping into geometry.
      i think a hat in time always has snapping if the geometry isn't a prop.
      pseudoregalia might apply mario's method with a hat in time's.
      celeste 64 might only snap if the width of the obstruction is too large since it still clips.
    </p>
    <p>
      something i didn't see very often was lookahead, which is normally quite common in 2D games.
      obviously if you're holding a certain direction you want to go that way so the camera should point to show what's ahead.
      while automatic camera adjustment serves this purpose alot of the time this could result in fighting with the camera for certain angles.
      lookahead in 2D simply shifts the camera so a larger portion of the screen is in front of the character.
      the same principle could be applied based on how perpendicular to the camera the character is moving which i've only seen in pseudoregalia.
      applying this for rotation essentially gives us the normal camera adjustment we see but this usually applied relative to the player and not on the camera itself.
      honestly there's plenty of routes to go in terms of making the camera point in the most optimal way.
