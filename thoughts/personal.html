      yeah lmao i don't know if writing this is a good idea we'll have to see.
      i dunno if i'm a lightweight or not but current evidence is pointing to a big fat fucking YAAAAAs
      honestly i'm pretty fine with that and would probably prefer to keep my alcohol tolerance low tbh
      (more bang for your buck am i right or am i right?)
      i wouldn't say i'm much of an alcohol connosieur either way -
      beer's fucking disgusting because it's so fucking bitter, wine is drunk by pretentious people and whisky compelled me to write this shitfest lol.
      cider is nice big fan apples are my favourite fruit yeahh i'm a basic bitch i know but i just don't like the texture and flavour of most fruits
      like you want to eat a pear? a fucking pear? have fun chewing on the fibres which grate against your teeth.
      a kiwi perhaps? it tastes and feels like in your mouth how cartoon snot looks like it would.
      i stan all vegetables though. just fucking cook them or they're shit no surprise thats part of british culture STIR FRIED LETTUCE SLAPS TRUST.
      wow i mean i think the alcohol is getting to me i can already notice i'm talking aloud alot more shit and laughing in the wheezy way i do.
      like i think i have three different levels of laugh and i want to keep it that way because it keeps me #quirky xoxo o=o
      like if something's ok or i'm laughing because i'm reading the room i'll do a normie chuckle...a cheeky chuckle
      but if something is really getting to me then i'll give it a wheeze or a weird fucking inhale
      and that can then evolve into the magnum opus, the grand finale, the apex, the zenith, the titan wing, the mega forme, my iconic witch cackle which should be the goal for any prospective comedians out there.
      my friend patrick does this thing when i reach this state where the fucker makes a stirring motion with his hands and makes direct eye contact to wrile me up even more.
      anyway i'm getting sidetracked all that happened was there was some whisky left in a glass which nobody wanted and i was like shit i could have that if no-one wants it.
      i've had a baileys and that's always really tasty but apparently i took two shots worth of whisky in one gulp which i'm sure is TOTALLY FINE
      my throat felt tingly hehe
      um but apparently six shots is what most people get tipsy on which is weird because i believe i am feeling effects after that even after i made SOME FUCKING BOMB PASTA with my smuggled steak from the master's buffet, carrots, beans, onion and mushrooms
      oughhh i should've taken a picture dammit oh wait no my phone was out of charge because using spotify in conjuction with google maps makes shit DRAIN
      anyway i've drunk entire bottles of cider (from my extremely sweet aunt on my bday) and been fine so this could literally be all in my head
      whoagh this could just be me somehow convincing myself i'm drunk when i'm literally fine...hold on pause for stumble check???
      ...
      ...
      maybe but also i could be faking stumbling...i literally never write for my blog like why now of all times am i deluding myself this much?
      i mean it's kinda fun to be stumbly but even right now i'm still aware enough to write coherently...we'll see if this is coherent tomorrow morning
      but then again i've always been extremely pedantic with spelling so maybe i'll be a spelling bitch regardless of how delirious i get.
      i don't even think alcohol's that amazing like OMG APPLETISER? SCHLOER? ELDERFLOWER CORDIAL? GINGER BEER? any day over cider...
      although i do normally get cider at ceilidh band sessions because they're badasses who give out free drinks and it's fun to be a bit buzzed up and play folk music in a pub
      if this article is just the product of me being slightly under the influence then maybe this is a more genuine version of me (although that's bad thinking which creates *jazz hands* alcoholics *cheering*)
      i'd say i'm a fairly guarded person and am way too slow to come out of my shell.
      for gods sake i had no friends in year 7.
      this could also just be coming from a place of writing shit down being so much more personal and me feeling safe to dump my brain tingles
      or it could be from a place of sleep deprivation coming from the consistent pipeline of sidbar friday -> late night -> 9am lecture saturday
      although i think with that i'm doing a lot better than some certain people *cough* harry *cough*.
      i might be sleep's bitch but i'll be a well rested bitch without those horrifically deep eyebags my dad has
      wow it's only twenty to 1am i'm doing okay and i can wake up whenever i want for once (perhaps this is a call for help hmmm...)
      also this is probably the most i've written on this website period and it's just my drunken/placebo drunken ramblings.
      ya know what time for bed fuck you

        if you didn't know i am half british and half chinese.
        have been all my life funnily enough and i think it's granted me a very unique cultural perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        because my dad couldn't speak mandarin (also because my mum was at home less) i didn't speak mandarin at home
        although i did go to a "chinese school" every week to learn the language.
        the school was a place where chinese families could meet and chat while the kids learnt.
        i always felt out of place because i was the only one who didn't have black hair
        (which is weird because every other half'n half person i know does)
        and i personally don't feel i look very chinese anyway,
        although according to other people and a face ai i do.
        i definitely wouldn't have the confidence to join any chinese clubs at my uni since i'd definitely feel alienated.
      </p>
      <p>
        i can speak mandarin fairly well and can hold a conversation with anyone who speaks standard mandarin
        but definitely have more to be desired in terms of language ability because i couldn't speak it at home.
        this hurts how well i can connect with my chinese family -
        although many speak in dialects which sound completely alien anyway.
        of course i love them very much but i do feel slightly disconnected,
        not only because of my background but also because i'm not considered part of the main family line (i don't have the surname).
      </p>
      <p>
        i had two very different cooking styles in my household:
        my dad served cauliflower cheese, casserole, pies and sausages while my mum brought noodles, rice, dumplings, 粥 and 粽子 to the table.
        i loved this and i think it really sucks that most families don't have as large a range of dishes.
        it also meant i didn't hate vegetables like the rest of the people in this country because i had stir-fried vegetables.
        COOK YOUR FUCKING VEGETABLES DON'T PUT THEM IN A SALAD.
      </p>
      <p>
        i was able to experience both cultures simultaneously which was very cool.
        i know quite a few immigrant families don't celebrate a lot of festivals like bonfire night, halloween and christmas
        and obviously most british families don't celebrate 春节, 中秋节, 端午节 or 清明节
        so i felt very priveliged to be able to both trick or treat and make dumplings with good company
      </p>
      <p>
        i honestly don't think the uk's a very racist place, at least where i'm from.
        of course there's the whole 'ching chong' stuff that happens on the playground in primary school
        but other than that i haven't experienced anything and neither have any of my not-ethnically-british friends as far as i know.
      </p>
      <p>
        funniest story i got from it was getting asked if i was mixed race by a drunk chinese lady at a corner shop at 3 am where i just bought some ginger beer

    		well this is my first post on my first website! ISN'T THAT COOL?
        i think i've always wanted a little outlet to just talk about stuff i love that no-one else really gives a shit about.
      </p>
      <p>
        i initially heard about neocities from a great <a href="https://youtu.be/rTSEr0cRJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> about the indie web -
        i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed and want to be a part of this lovely community.
        i've always been a big believer that the internet is for collaboration and sharing, especially in regards to open source software and learning resources.
        additionally, despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it.
      </p>
      <p>
        in terms of what i actually want this website to be i want it to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies.
        one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of unoriginal trash that already exists here
        this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
      </p>
      <p>
        what will i actually do here then?
        <ul>
          <li>i want to create a ridiculous amount of shrines!</li>
          <li>i want to talk about subjects on my mind or important to me!</li>
          <li>i want to braindump intricacies of coding stuff!</li>
          <li>i want to make and post covers of tracks i love!</li>
          <li>i want to find other people who like things i like and be their friend!</li>
          <li>i want to find incredible personal websites!</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>thank you neocities!</p>
