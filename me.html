        <summary>missing out</summary>
        despite being born in the 2000s i missed the entirety of the early internet so i thought that this would be a nice way to try and experience it

        <summary>website</summary>
        i want this website to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies
        <br>
        one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of linktrees and empty spaces
        <br>
        this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine

        i wholeheartedly agree that the mainstream internet has regressed from what it was and want to be a part of this lovely community
