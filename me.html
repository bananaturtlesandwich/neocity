        <summary>website</summary>
        i want this website to be a place i can ramble about my interests, dump my thoughts and document my hobbies
        <br>
        one thing i really don't want to do is add to the pile of unoriginal trash that already exists here
        <br>
        this should be a place which is completely, absolutely, truly mine
