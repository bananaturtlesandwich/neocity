      <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/bananaturtlesandwich/stove" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stove</a>
        is an editor for cooked unreal engine maps
      </p>
      <h1>concept</h1>
      <p>
        the idea for stove originally came when i was researching how unreal's map format worked for the blue fire rando
        so that i could delete, duplicate, transplant or edit actors
        which would allow me place any drops according to the seed
      </p>
      <p>
        to easier debug this research, clearly a graphical editor was the most logical method to visualise it
        (definitely not the words of a lunatic who didn't know anything about graphics).
        i was also inspired by the work of Jupahe64 on spotlight (the super mario 3D world editor)
